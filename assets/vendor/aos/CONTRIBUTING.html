<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>Found a bug? Have a problem with AOS? Please check past issues, maybe someone already had that problem. If you don&#39;t find similar issue create new, but remember to add accurate informations so that I can dig into it straight away. If it&#39;s possible add CodePen example that presents called issue.</p>
<h2 id="development-process">Development process</h2>
<p>AOS is built using webpack.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Install all dependencies: </p>
<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run dev server:</p>
<pre><code>npm run dev
</code></pre><p>This will run local webpack-dev-server and build AOS automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open browser and head to: 
<a href="http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/">http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/</a>
Server loads content from <code>demo</code> folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you are ready to play with AOS. Browser should reload automatically as you change code in <code>src</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Before you create Pull Request make sure all tests are passing.</p>
<p>In order to do so run:</p>
<pre><code>npm test
</code></pre><h3 id="commiting-changes">Commiting changes</h3>
<p>If all tests are passing then you&#39;re good to go. Commit your changes, but remember to <strong>not commit <code>dist</code> folder</strong>.
Create well described Pull Request with as many informations as possible and wait for my answer :) I&#39;d be happy to make a code review and put some thougths.</p>
